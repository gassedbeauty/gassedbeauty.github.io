            These pancakes are a copycat of the viral ones from Middle Child in 
            Philly, where the secret is yeast, giving them that perfectly airy, 
            fluffy texture you can’t get from regular pancakes. They’re blowing 
            up on TikTok, but if you’ve ever tried to get them at either Middle 
            Child or Golden Diner in NYC, you know the lines are insane. Forget 
            the wait and the travel—these golden, melt-in-your-mouth pancakes 
            can be made right at home, anytime!

      <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
        <ul>
            <h5>BATTER - PROOF:</h5>
            <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
            <h5>BATTER - DRY:</h5>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <h5>BATTER - WET:</h5>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <h5>HONEY MAPLE BUTTER SAUCE</h5>
            <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
            <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <h5>OTHER</h5>
            <li>Cubes of butter, to add on top</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the whole milk, buttermilk, 
                flour, instant yeast, and sugar. Let it bloom in a warm place 
                for 1 hour until bubbly and airy.</li>
            <li>While the yeast is blooming, make the honey butter maple sauce: 
                over medium-low heat, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Then 
                stir in the honey, maple syrup, and a pinch of salt until smooth 
                and glossy. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla 
                extract until smooth and well combined.</li>
            <li>Once the batter has bloomed, add the whisked wet ingredients to 
                it and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: flour, 
                baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li> Add the dry mix to the batter and whisk gently just until no 
                more dry bits remain. Do not overmix—the batter should be thick 
                and a little lumpy.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Onee preheated, add your skillet 
                inside and let it preheat for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the hot skillet, grease it with a bit of oil, 
                then pour in about 1¼ to 1½ cups of batter.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the pancake is puffed up and 
                golden on top.</li>
             <li>Flip over on a plate, add a slice of butter, and drizzle with 
                the warm honey butter maple sauce to cover the entire surface.
                Enjoy warm.</li>
          </ol>
      <h4>TIPS & TRICKS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>For even more a cake texture/crumb, add an extra 1/4 cup of
                whole milk to the proof mixture.</li>

            <h5>STEAK:</h5>
            <li>1 pound thinly shaved steak</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup beef broth</li>
            <h5>VEGGIES:</h5>
            <li>1/2 large yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil</li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
            <li>black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <h5>FOR ASSEMBLY</h5>
            <li>12-pack Hawaiian rolls</li>
            <li>mayonnaise, for toasting bread (optional)</li>
            <li>4 to 6 slices cheese (Cooper Sharp, provolone, or cheese wiz)</li>
            <li>melted unsalted butter, for brushing tops</li>
            <li>toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Cook the Veggies: In a pan over medium heat, add neutral oil. 
                Once hot, toss in the diced onion and sliced bell pepper. Season 
                with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Sauté until softened and 
                slightly caramelized, about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the minced 
                garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. Remove from 
                the pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook the Steak: In the same pan, melt butter with neutral oil 
                over medium-high heat. Add the shaved steak, breaking it apart 
                as it cooks.Season with salt, paprika, mustard powder, and black 
                pepper. Once the steak is browned, pour in Worcestershire sauce
                and cook for another minute. Then, pour in the beef broth to 
                deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits for extra flavor. 
                Let it simmer for 2 minutes until slightly reduced. Remove from 
                heat.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Rolls: Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Keeping 
                the Hawaiian rolls connected, slice them in half horizontally. 
                Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on the cut sides. Place them 
                mayo-side up on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for a few 
                minutes until lightly golden.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Sliders: Place the bottom half of the toasted rolls 
                in a baking dish or tray. Evenly spread the cooked steak over 
                the bread, then layer the sautéed veggies on top. Add your 
                choice of Cooper Sharp, provolone, or Cheese Whiz over the 
                veggies. Place the top half of the rolls on.</li>
            <li>Finish and Bake: Brush the tops with melted butter and sprinkle 
                with toasted sesame seeds. Cover loosely with foil and bake for 
                10 to 15 minutes until the cheese is melted. Then, remove the 
                foil and bake for another 5 minutes until the tops are golden 
                brown.
            <li>Serve: Let the sliders cool slightly before pulling them apart. 
                Enjoy warm!</li>
          </ol>
      <h4>TIPS & TRICKS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Freeze the Steak: Place your steak in the freezer for about 
                30-45 minutes. This firms it up, making it much easier to slice 
                thinly.</li>
            <li>Slice Against the Grain: After the steak firms up, remove it 
                from the freezer. Using a sharp knife, slice the steak thinly 
                against the grain (those lines running through the meat). Aim f
                or slices about 1/8 inch thick. If you have a mandoline slicer,
                you can use that for even thinner slices!</li>
